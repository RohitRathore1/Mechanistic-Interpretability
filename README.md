# Mechanistic Interpretability

This repository is my playground for Mechanistic Interpretability where I will push all my code-examples
and readings which I am doing while practicing.

## Reproduced Examples

- [How to: Transformer Mechanistic Interpretability â€”with 50 lines of code or less!]
(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hnzHrdqn3nrjveayv/how-to-transformer-mechanistic-interpretability-in-50-lines) \
I was facing errors during plotting the plots in this example, I fixed these bugs using `Matplotlib` where I used 
my own matplotlib code.

## Important Libraries
